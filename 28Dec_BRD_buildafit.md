3. A new study examining the wardrobes of 2,000 men and women found the average person experiences 'wardrobe panic' 36 times a year because they feel they have nothing to wear.The study by Trunk Club, a personal styling service, found that nearly 61 percent of Americans admitted they regularly find themselves struggling to find something to wear, even though their closet is full of clothing.

Problem statement

1. Customers struggle to build outfits using their own closet leading to frustration and the sense that "I have nothing to wear". 
2. Customers struggle to find creative ways to use their closet and typically end up repeating standard combinations that may lead to boredom with the closet. 

Because of this, customers today waste time, energy, and money struggling to put together outfits even with a large closet. They need a way to easily put together outfits using their closet, making this process fun and exciting.
